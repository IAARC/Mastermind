# Mastermind
This is my version of the game "Mastermind". In this game of one player and twelve rounds, you have to choose whether being code maker or the code breaker. As a code breaker, you objective is to figure out the code created by the computer. As a code maker, you must create the best code to not be defeated by the computer!.
